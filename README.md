# Survival-Analysis-Cancer-Research

Ovarian cancer is a rare but deadly gynecological cancer. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) estimate new ovarian cancer cases with comprise 1% of all new cancer cases in 2022, however, the 5-year age-adjusted survival rate after diagnosis for ovarian cancer is 50%. On average, Asian-Americans are known to have better survival compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) Americans. However, in these studies, Asian Americans have been grouped under a single category despite encompassing numerous cultures of people. To aid in the effort of separating these populations, we analyze 9 sub-Asian populations using non-Hispanic white as the base line. In particular, we compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the restricted mean survival times of these data. From this, we determine significant populations to consider in regards to ovarian cancer survival time.
